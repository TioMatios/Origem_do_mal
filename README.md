# Origem_do_mal



This is a school project built with the Dart language and the Flutter framework.



## ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration



This is a collaborative project developed by me (Matheus) and my classmate Ismael.



We split the work on some of the main features:



* **API Integration (Home Page):** Implemented by Ismael.

* **"Reels" and "Inicio" (Home) Screens:** Developed by me (Matheus).

* **Core Features:** The app also uses an external API and the "shared_preferences" plugin for local data.
